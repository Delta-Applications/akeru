Refurbished KaiOS Apps
</p>

## 📖 What are refurbished apps?

Akeru refurbished apps are versions of stock/official KaiOS apps from 2.5.2, modified to have design features taken from 2.5.4+ (new icons, rounded corners, etc.).

## 📁 Folders

### `stock-refurbished`

Contains all stock apps from 2.5.2 KaiOS (primarily from the 800T), refurbished to have extra functionality and latest design features (for example radio without headphones, modified settings app, unit conversion with latest icons, etc.)

### `official-refurbished`

Contains all refurbished official apps: modified apps from the KaiOS team extracted from the KaiStore, with as many online features as possible removed (ads & tracking), intended to be used as bloat-free stock apps (like weather & network tester)

### `stock`

Contains all stock apps from all KaiOS device & version. Each app is fundamentally different as features like icons, fonts, and design language vary across versions & devices.
