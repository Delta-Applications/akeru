<h2>Radio waves</h2>
THIS PHONE MEETS THE GOVERNMENT’S REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPOSURE TO RADIO WAVES.</br>
Your phone is a radio transmitter and receiver. It is designed and manufactured not to exceed the emission limits for exposure to radio-frequency (RF) energy. These limits are part of comprehensive guidelines and establish permitted levels of RF energy for the general population. The guidelines are based on standards that were developed by independent scientific organizations through periodic and thorough evaluation of scientific studies. These guidelines include a substantial safety margin designed to ensure the safety of all persons, regardless of age and health.</br>
The exposure standard for phones employs a unit of measurement known as the Specific Absorption Rate, or SAR. The SAR limit set by public authorities such as the Federal Communications Commission of the US Government (FCC), or by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISEDC), is 1.6 W/kg averaged over 1 gram of body tissue. Tests for SAR are conducted using standard operating positions with the phone transmitting at its highest certified power level in all tested frequency bands.</br>
This device is complied with SAR for general population /uncontrolled exposure limits in ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992 and had been tested in accordance with the measurement methods and procedures specified in IEEE1528.</br>
The FCC has granted an Equipment Authorization for this model phone with all reported SAR levels evaluated as in compliance with the FCC RF exposure guidelines. SAR information on this model phone is on file with the FCC and can be found under the Display Grant section of www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid after searching on FCC ID: 2ACCJN010</br>
Although the SAR is determined at the highest certified power level, the actual SAR level of the phone while operating can be well below the maximum value. This is because the phone is designed to operate at multiple power levels so as to use only the power required to reach the network. In general, the closer you are to a wireless base station antenna, the lower the power output of the phone. Before a phone model is available for sale to the public, compliance with national regulations and standards must be shown.</br>
The highest SAR value for this model phone when tested is <span id="head">1.21</span> W/Kg for use at the ear and <span id="body">1.40</span> W/Kg for use close to the body. </br>
While there may be differences between the SAR levels of various phones and at various positions, they all meet the government requirement for RF exposure.</br>
For body-worn operation, the phone meets FCC RF exposure guidelines provided that it is used with a non-metallic accessory with the handset at least 15 mm from the body. Use of other accessories may not ensure compliance with FCC RF exposure guidelines.</br>
Additional information on SAR can be found on the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association (CTIA) Web site: http://www.ctia.org/</br>
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers that present scientific information does not indicate the need for any special precautions for use of phones. If individuals are concerned, they might choose to limit their own or their children’s RF exposure by limiting the length of calls, or using “hands-free” devices to keep phones away from the head and body. Additional WHO information about electromagnetic fields and public health are available on the following website: http://www.who.int/peh-emf.</br>
